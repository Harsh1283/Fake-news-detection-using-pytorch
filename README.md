This project is a **Fake News Detection System** built using **PyTorch**. It uses a feed-forward neural network with a Bag-of-Words (BoW) vectorizer to classify news headlines as either **REAL** or **FAKE**.



 üöÄ Features

- Trained using a simple 3-layer fully connected neural network.
-Uses TF-IDF vectorization on headlines.
-Web app built with Streamlit for real-time prediction.
-Detects whether a given news headline is likely Real or Fake.


 üß† Model Architecture

- Input Layer: 5000-dimensional BoW vector
- Hidden Layers: [512, 256] neurons with ReLU and Dropout
- Output Layer: 1 neuron with Sigmoid
- Loss: Binary Cross Entropy
- Optimizer: Adam
